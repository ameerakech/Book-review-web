            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>In Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, comedian and television personality Trevor
                Noah<br>
                gives a heartfelt and funny recounting of his experiences growing up in South Africa as an oppressed
                person.
                <br>
                Stories of Noah’s life are interspersed with insights into South Africa’s culture, systems, and
                history.<br>
                Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, during the time of racial segregation known as
                apartheid.<br>
                Patricia was a strong, driven woman who paid little heed to the racist laws that oppressed her. Noah’s
                father, Robert,<br>
                agreed to give Patricia a child during a time when sexual relationships between black and white South
                Africans were illegal. <br>
                Robert, a Swiss immigrant, never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid.<br>
                Because it was dangerous for Patricia and Robert to be seen with their mixed-race child,<br>
                Noah recalls sometimes being momentarily abandoned by his parents in public settings.

            <h3>A Life in Color</h3>
            <p>If I were to rename Born a Crime, I would call it A Life in Color.<br>
                I picked this title to represent Trevor's mixed heritage and social labels <br>
                that described life as a South African.The word color aslso represents a life colored<br>
                in bold refusing to be dulled by oppression. Color also represents the vibrancy in him<br>
                Trevor Noah is a humorous person and resourceful as well</p>

    <p>The quote that states, “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife,<br> but he never fell
        in
        love
        with subservient women. He only wants a free woman because his dream is to put her in a cage.<br>

        Abel’s longing for a traditional wife deeply highlights a desire for traditional gender norms by wanting
        a woman who prioritizes<br> housewifery,yet his admiration for free women, I suppose, aligns with my view of
        hypocrisy in most relationships where partners<br> claim to value independence but then limit it. For
        instance,
        a
        man
        might
        support a woman’s career path but then expect her to <br>prioritize family over work, which relates well
        with
        Abel’s
        cage.<br>

        This quote talks about traditional gender roles and explores how complex marriage and relationships are.
        Abel’s need for a traditional <br>wife might be a way of controlling his environment,<br> which can lead to
        violence
        and
        abuse, while Patricia’s character challenges these traditional ways with modern ways of thinking.<br>

        However, this quote also illustrates the ongoing struggle in our societies to reconcile traditional
        values
        with
        modern social changes<br> because true equality in relationships involves dismantling these cages and
        celebrating
        freedom, not control, true love, not hate, and mutual respect from both sides.</p>
